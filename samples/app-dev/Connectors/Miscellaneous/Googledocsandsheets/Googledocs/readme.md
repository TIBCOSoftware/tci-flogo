# Google Docs Example


## Description

Google Docs allows you to store the output of any activity in a Google Document. The Google Document can then be shared with multiple users. The content of the document can be retrieved and transformed to a MIME type and used as an input by the subsequent activities.

This example demonstrates how we can create and use Google Docs activities.
Google Docs bascially contains 5 activities. The main purpose of these activities are:

a) Google Docs Create: To create a new Google document.

b) Google Docs Get: To get the content of the document.The data is formatted according to the mimetype selected. 

c) Google Docs Update: To update the data and metadata of Google documents.

d) Google Docs Delete: To permanently delete a document.

e) Google Docs Copy: To copy a document to one or more new folders.

In this sample we will first create a copy of existing document, get it's contents, create a new document, update it (You can update the metadata as well as the content) and finally we will delete the newly created document. we will perform these functions using Google Docs activities mentioned above.

## Prerequisites

1. TIBCO Cloud™ Integration.
2. You must have access to any document that needs to be accessed by the connection. Documents created will be owned by the service account.
3. If you run any of these samples locally using TIBCO Flogo® Enterprise -Ensure that the connector is installed.

## Import the sample

1. Download the sample json file i.e., Google_docs.json.

2. Create a new empty app.

3. On the app details page, select import app option.

4. Now click on ‘browse to upload’ button and select the app.json from your machine that you want to import.

5. Click on Upload Button. The Import app dialog displays some generic errors and warnings as well as any specific errors or warnings pertaining to the app you are importing.

6. In Import App dialog, there are 2 options to import:

* Selective Import – If you are choosing this option then select trigger, flow and connection and click Next.

* Import all – If you are choosing this option then it will import all flows from the source app.

7. After importing app is done, in connection tab make sure to provide the Service Account Key and click on save button to establish the connection.

## Understanding the configuration

### The Connection
The Google connection contains all the parameters required to connect to your Google service account. The Google connection is used by all the activities in the Google Docs category.

When you import the app, click on save button to establish the connection.

### The Flow

If you go inside the app, you can see in flow we have 5 activities (Copy,Create,Get,Delete and Update) that perform some operations.
Also in flow we have Log Message and Return Activity for getting the output.

### Run the application
For running the application, first you have to push the app and then scale up the app.
Then after sometime you can see your app in running status.

Once your app reaches to Running state, go to Endpoints and for GET/tasks, select 'Try it Out’ option and then click on execute.

Another option, If you want to test the sample in the Flow tester then follow below instructions:
 
in flow, click on Test Button -> create Launch configuration -> click Next button -> click on Run

## Outputs

1. Flow Tester

2. When hit endpoints

## Troubleshooting

* If you do not see the Endpoint enabled, make sure your apps is in Running status.
