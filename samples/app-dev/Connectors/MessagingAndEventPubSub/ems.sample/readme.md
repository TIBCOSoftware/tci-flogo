# Using EMS extension in Flogo leveraging TCI supplement mechanism


## Description

This is EMS sample. It demonstrates how to use EMS extension in Flogo leveraging TCI supplement mechanism.
EMS connector allows you to send or receive message from TIBCO Enterprise Messaging Service (EMS).

## Capabilities included

* Connection - Connection configuration
* Trigger - Receive message(text/object) on topic/queue
* Activity - Send message(text/object) on topic/queue

## Prerequisites

* For connector to work in TCI, Linux EMS native libraries must be uploaded. To upload required libraries, we will be using TCI supplement mechanism using the below command -
* tibcli flogoconnector supplement EMS*

* Upload the connector from this github location - https://github.com/TIBCOSoftware/tci-flogo/tree/master/samples/extensions/EMS 


## Understanding the configuration

Once you have supplemented EMS from tibcli and uploaded extenstion to TCI, then import the attached *ems.sample.json* app in TCI. 


You will need to configure the EMS Connection used in the app. You can either use EMS hosted on public cloud or hosted on your on-premise machines.


In order to use on-prem EMS server in TCI, you will either have to attach VPN Connection to your app or attach Access Key to use Hybrid Connectivity.


For more details on how to use *Hybrid Connectivity/tibtunnel/Proxy Agent*, please refer this TCI documentation - https://integration.cloud.tibco.com/docs/using/hybrid-connectivity/proxy-agent/using-proxy-agent.html

## Import a sample

1. Download the sample's .json file.

2. Create a new empty app.

4. Browse on your machine or drag and drop the .json file for the app that you want to import.

5. Click Upload. The Import app dialog displays some generic errors and warnings as well as any specific errors or warnings pertaining to the app you are importing. It validates whether all the activities and triggers used in the app are available in the Extensions tab.

6. You have the option to import all flows from the source app or selectively import flows.

7. Click Next. If you had not selected a trigger in the previous dialog, the flows associated with that trigger are displayed. You have the option to select one or more of these flows such that the flows get imported as blank flows that are not attached to any trigger. By default, all flows are selected. Clear the check box for the flows that you do not want to import. If your flow(s) have subflows, and you select only the main flow but do not select the subflow, the main flow gets imported without the subflow. Click Next.
