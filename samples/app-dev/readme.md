Below is a list of steps to import the Flogo application/sample. Every sample also has separate readme instructions after importing the app. 

## Steps to Import a Flogo application/sample. 

1. Download the JSON file. (Sample Flogo app)

2. Create a new Flogo app.

3. On the app details page, select Import app option.

4. Browse and upload the JSON file of the app to be imported (from step #1).

5. Once the app is imported, some generic errors and warnings pertaining to the app are listed. This step validates whether all the activities and triggers used in the app are available in the Extensions tab.

6. Users have an option to either selectively import specific flows or import all flows from the source app. Rename the app once it is imported successfully. 

7. If a trigger in the previous dialog is not selected, the flows associated with that trigger are displayed. Users have an option to select one or more of these flows such that the flows get imported as blank flows that are not attached to any trigger. By default, all flows are selected. Uncheck the check box for the flows that you do not want to import. If your flow(s) have subflows, and you select only the main flow but do not select the subflow, the main flow gets imported without the subflow.

## Testing the Flogo flows. 
Please follow the documentation [here](https://integration.cloud.tibco.com/docs/#Subsystems/flogo/flogo-all/flow-tester2.html?TocPath=TIBCO%2520Flogo%25C2%25AE%2520Apps%257CApp%2520Development%257CFlow%2520Tester%257C_____0) to test the Flogo flows imported using the above steps.
