# Hello World Sample


This sample is a simple Flogo app that prints and returns a greeting based on the input you provide to it. It uses a HTTP trigger to receive a HTTP message with the following parameters:
* Port: 9999
* Method: GET
* Resource path: `/hello/{name}`

The trigger of this sample retrieves the value of the path parameter `name` which is passed to the activities of the flow named sayHello. This flow includes two activities:
1. Log activity: it prints `Name: {name}` in the logs. Ex: `Name: world` if you entered 'world' as a path parameter.

2. Return activity: it returns a JSON object `{ "message": "Hello world"}` if you entered 'world' as a path parameter.

5. Click Upload. The Import app dialog displays some generic errors and warnings as well as any specific errors or warnings pertaining to the app you are importing. It validates whether all the activities and triggers used in the app are available in the Extensions tab.

6. You have the option to import all flows from the source app or selectively import flows.

7. Click Next. If you had not selected a trigger in the previous dialog, the flows associated with that trigger are displayed. You have the option to select one or more of these flows such that the flows get imported as blank flows that are not attached to any trigger. By default, all flows are selected. Clear the check box for the flows that you do not want to import. If your flow(s) have subflows, and you select only the main flow but do not select the subflow, the main flow gets imported without the subflow. Click Next.
