# 3. Building a Orchestration-based Saga using TIBCO Cloud™ Platform

In this section, you'll build the main orchestration-based saga component using TIBCO Cloud™ Events Studio, configure TIBCO Cloud Messaging. 

After this section you'll deploy pre-built microservices to TIBCO Cloud that will allow you to test the solution.


## 3.1 Lab Objectives

In this lab, you will create and deploy a TIBCO Cloud™ Events solution that will implement an orchestration-based saga based on a very simple Order use-case:

1. Take Payment - implemented by Payment Microservice
2. Prepare Order - implemented by Stock Microservice
3. Ship Order - implemented by Delivery Microservice

We will have 1 orchestration service and 3 microservices implementing asynchronous command-reply message communication pattern.

The orchestration service will be built using TIBCO Cloud Events and the 3 microservice participants will be built using TIBCO BusinessWorks. TIBCO Cloud™ Messaging will be used for the reliable messaging layer.

### 3.3 Create Concept Definitions

Within TIBCO Cloud Events, a Concept definition is used to define objects and their properties. Concepts are similar to object-oriented concept of a class in that they represent class-level information. At runtime the instance of a concept are called objects and are persisted in memory or database.

> Further information about Concepts can be found on our on-line documentation [here](https://events.cloud.tibco.com/docs/tce/GUID-2706E8B9-5BD8-49D2-9FD2-F1CF847C4D95.html)

For our use-case we are going to create 4 concepts:

* Order - holds the Order properties (Order ID , Customer ID, email, and Order State)
* Order Item - holds the Order Items (Item Unit Price, Quantity Ordered, Line Price)
* Shipping Address - holds the Order Shipping properties (Address Lines, City, Country, and Postcode)
* InFlightOrders - tracks Orders ID

#### 3.3.1 Create Shipping Address Concept

1. Right click in the Studio Explorer view, select New->Concept...

![NewConceptDialogue](images/002/NewConceptDialog.png)


2.	A dialog box will appear for you to create a new concept. 
3. Enter 'ShippingAddress' in the concept name field 
4. Click 'Finish' button.

![NewConceptDialogue](images/002/NewConceptShippingAddress.png)

Your screen should look similar to this:

![](images/002/ShippingAddressConcept.png)

3.	Using the Concept Properties editor, click + and add the following 5 properties:

* address1 - Type=String
* address2 - Type=String
* city - Type=String
* country - Type=String
* postcode - Type=String

Click 'Save' icon on the toolbar.

![ShippingAddressConceptProperties](images/002/ShippingAddressConceptProperties.png)


#### 3.3.2 Create Order Item Concept

Now that you've created your first concept, go ahead and create Order Item concept. This time use 'OrderItem' as the Concept name.

Add the following 3 properties to the Order Item concept:

* item_name - Type=String
* price - Type=double
* quantity - Type=int

Your Order Item concept should look like this:

![OrderItemConceptProperties](images/002/OrderItemConceptProperties.png)

Click 'Save' icon on the toolbar.


#### 3.3.3 Create In-Flight Order Concept

You should be a 'dab-hand' now at creating concepts, go ahead and create In-flight Order Concept. This time use 'InFlightOrders' as the Concept name.

Add the following property to the In-Flight Order concept:

* order_id - Type=String

Your In-Flight Order Concept should look like this:

![OrderItemConceptProperties](images/002/InFlightOrdersConceptProperties.png)

Click 'Save' icon on the toolbar.



#### 3.3.4 Create Order Concept

We've left the Order Concept to last, this is because we're going to reference Order Item and Shipping Address concepts as properties of the Order concept. Go ahead and create Order Concept. This time use 'Orders' as the Concept name.

Add the following property to the In-Flight Order Concept:

* order_id - Type=String
* customer_id - Type=String
* email - Type=String
* items - Type=ContainedConcept, Resource=OrderItem, Multiple=enabled
* address - Type=ContainedConcept, Resource=ShippingAddress

Your Order Concept should look like this:

![OrderConceptProperties](images/002/OrderConceptProperties.png)

Click 'Save' icon on the toolbar.

### 3.4 Create Connection Shared Resource Definitions

We need to get data in and out of TIBCO Cloud Events, to do this we need to create two connections:

* HTTP Connection - this will be used by TIBCO Cloud Events to receive the initial Order JSON request.
* TCM Connection - this will be used by TIBCO Cloud Events to send & receive asynchronous messages with.

Shared Resources can be created in TIBCO Cloud Events and used by components of the solution. Shared Resources configure the connection and contain properties such as host address, url, or passwords.

> Further information about Shared Resources can be found on our on-line documentation [here](https://events.cloud.tibco.com/docs/tce/GUID-2706E8B9-5BD8-49D2-9FD2-F1CF847C4D95.html)

### 3.5 Create Channels and Destinations

Channels are the messaging transport where events enter or exit TIBCO Cloud Events. A channel uses connection resource.

A channel may have one or more destination, which represents a source of messages from that connection resource as well as a sink of messages that are to be sent to the outside.

Whenever we wish to interact with participants either sending or receiving messages we do so through Channels and Destinations.  

> Further information about Channels and Destinations can be found on our on-line documentation [here] https://events.cloud.tibco.com/docs/tce/GUID-D02FBE15-D4AA-415D-B488-DA3CD6CBC46C.html

For our use-case we are going to create 4 channels:

* Order - HTTP Channel used for sending in an Order request.
* Payment - TCM Channel used to communicate with the Payment Microservice using async messaging.
* Stock - TCM Channel used to communicate with the Stock Microservice using async messaging.

### 3.5 Create Events

An event is an object representing some occurence or point of time. In our use-case events represent business activities such as Take Order Payment or Deliver Order. When messages arrive on channel destinations we assign these messages to events. Channel destinations either emit or consume events from external participants.

Events model state similar to concept properties.

> Further information about Events can be found on our on-line documentation [here] https://events.cloud.tibco.com/docs/tce/GUID-FEE4D69B-177F-4A2A-9AB8-56754333F2BF.html

For our use-case we are going to create 9 events which represent the following interactions:

* OrderEvent - A new Order arriving.
* ReplyOrderEvent - Acknowledgement for a new Order.
* PaymentEvent - A payment for an Order is needed.
* RefundEvent - A refund on an Order is needed.
* PaymentExecuteEvent - Payment confirmation for an Order.

### 3.6 Create Rules & Rule Functions

Rules are the logic behind the events. Rules are executed whenever an Event is created or modified within TIBCO Cloud Events. Rules allow us to codify our business logic using Java. We use Rules and Events to determine the next action to take. The TIBCO Cloud Events engine will determine which rules to execute based on predicated logic e.g. Payment=APPROVED AND Order Status=PREPARED 

> Don't worry if you do not know Java programming, we've pre-prepared all the Rule logic for you :-)

> Further information about Rules can be found on our on-line documentation [here](https://events.cloud.tibco.com/docs/tce/GUID-42CEA3E9-33E2-4E15-834D-C1720AB59526.html)

> 
> The rule performs the following functionality:
> 
> * Sends HTTP Reply back to the client
> * Determines if an Order Instance already exists and if so consumes the Order Event thus stopping any rules being executed.
