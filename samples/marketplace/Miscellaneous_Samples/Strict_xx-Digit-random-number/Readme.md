# Random number (4 digit) generator

## Prerequisites
TIBCO Cloud™ Integration - latest version. 

## Overview
This TCI (Flogo) application flow generates 4 digit random and unique numbers. The logic can be further enhanced by generating numbers of any length per the user's choice in the input. The random number generation logic is particularly useful where users need unique identifiers (example: IDs) in their service implementation.

## Steps to use the Flogo application: 
1. Download the Flogo application (JSON file) from [here.](https://github.com/TIBCOSoftware/tci-flogo/blob/master/samples/app-dev/Miscellaneous_Samples/Strict_xx-Digit-random-number/flogo.json)
2. Login to TIBCO Cloud™ Integration with a valid subscription.
3. Steps to import the Flogo application (from step #1) is listed [here.](https://github.com/TIBCOSoftware/tci-flogo/blob/master/samples/app-dev/readme.md)
4. The imported Flogo app should look like shown below.
5. The logic to generate the 4 digit random number is in the Mapper activity called 4_digit_random_id_generator.
6. For any additional information, please raise your queries or issues via the Issues section.
