# Getting started


This page describe how to develop single independent Project Flogo contribution

The contribution includes `activity`, `trigger`, `function`,

I will take [Log](https://github.com/project-flogo/contrib/blob/master/activity/log) activity, [REST](https://github.com/project-flogo/contrib/tree/master/trigger/rest) Trigger and [json](https://github.com/project-flogo/contrib/tree/master/function/json) function as example below.

## Activity
| Component       | Technology | Filename                           | Description
| --------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------- | -----------
| Model           | JSON       | [descriptor.json](https://github.com/project-flogo/contrib/blob/master/activity/log/descriptor.json)                    | The `descriptor.json` describes the model, the meta data, of the activity. It describes, among other things, what the input and outputs are, who built it and which version you're using.
| Runtime         | Go         | [activity.go](https://github.com/project-flogo/contrib/blob/master/activity/log/activity.go)   | Every extension must write the runtime code in Go (`activity.go`). You can, and really should, leverage the Go testing framework for writing unit test cases (`activity_test.go`) for your extension.
| Runtime dependence | go.mod | [go.mod](https://github.com/project-flogo/contrib/blob/master/activity/log/go.mod) | The `go.mod` file describes all dependencies requires for this activity and the model name. Note here: The module name should be the ref of the contribution.

## Trigger
| Component       | Technology | Filename                           | Description
| --------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------- | -----------
| Model           | JSON       | [descriptor.json](https://github.com/project-flogo/contrib/blob/master/trigger/rest/descriptor.json)                    | The `descriptor.json` describes the model, the meta data, of the trigger. It describes, among other things, what the trigger settings, handlers andoutputs are, who built it and which version you're using.
| Runtime         | Go         | [trigger.go](https://github.com/project-flogo/contrib/blob/master/trigger/rest/trigger.go)   | Every extension must write the runtime code in Go (`trigger.go`). You can, and really should, leverage the Go testing framework for writing unit test cases (`trigger_test.go`) for your extension.
| Runtime dependence | go.mod | [go.mod](https://github.com/project-flogo/contrib/blob/master/trigger/rest/go.mod) | The `go.mod` file describes all dependencies requires for this trigger and the contribution model name. Note here: The module name should be the ref of the contribution.


* **Note** For activity and trigger
* The suffix of module name in go.mod file must be the activity or trigger name.  Take [Log Activity](https://github.com/project-flogo/contrib/blob/master/activity/log/go.mod) as example, the name must be `log`

## Function
| Component       | Technology | Filename                           | Description
| --------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------- | -----------
| Model           | JSON       | [descriptor.json](https://github.com/project-flogo/contrib/tree/master/function/json/descriptor.json)     | The `descriptor.json` describes the model, the meta data, of the function. it describe function name, argument and output which expected type.
| Runtime         | Go         | [functioName.go](https://github.com/project-flogo/contrib/tree/master/function/json/path.go)   | Every extension must write the runtime code in Go (`functionName.go`). You can, and really should, leverage the Go testing framework for writing unit test cases (`functionName_test.go`) for your extension.
| Runtime dependence  | go.mod | [go.mod](https://github.com/project-flogo/contrib/tree/master/function/json/go.mod) | The `go.mod` file describes all dependencies requires for this function and the function model name. Note here: The module name should be the ref of the contribution.

* **Note**
* The suffix of module name in go.mod file must be the function `category` name.  Take [JSON](https://github.com/project-flogo/contrib/tree/master/function/json) as example, the name must be `json`
* The folder name of the function must be `category` name.
* The root name of field in descriptor.json must be `category` name as well.
* Each functions name in descriptor.json must match the name that return from runtime go code `Name` method
```
func (fnPath) Name() string {
  return "path"
  }
```

## ***Attention***

All contribution must be registered into engine in each own go init function.  Please check [Log Activity Init](https://github.com/project-flogo/contrib/blob/master/activity/log/activity.go#L11), [Rest Trigger Init](https://github.com/project-flogo/contrib/blob/master/trigger/rest/trigger.go#L28) and [Json function init](https://github.com/project-flogo/contrib/blob/master/function/json/path.go#L11)

## Supported model type
Please refer to [here](https://github.com/project-flogo/core/blob/master/data/types.go) for all supported types in flogo

## Folder Layout

The layout of your folder has to follow a specific structure.
```
│ <activity name>
│        └───activity.go
│        └───descriptor.json
│        └───go.mod

```

```
│ <trigger name>
│        └───trigger.go
│        └───descriptor.json
│        └───go.mod

```

```
|───functionCategoryName
│   └───function.go
│   └───descriptor.json
│   └───go.mod
```

* **Note**
* Please note that all names of activities/trigger and connectors should be in lowercase
* For local Go code testing purpose, please create ref dir under your ${GOPATH}/src/${ref}, such as: github.com/project-flogo/contrib/activity/log/

## Upload
* Compress activity, trigger or function folder into zip and upload to [FLOGO Enterprise or TIBCO Cloud Integration](./../../../upload)
